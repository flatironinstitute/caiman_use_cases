CaImAn use_cases
======
This is a supplementary repo to the main CaImAn project: https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn
It contains additional code (unmaintained and possibly no longer working) that either
extends the project or demonstrates its use.

All of it used to live in the main repo, but was removed to make software maintenance easier and
to make choices of users to refer to it more of a deliberate process that has a clear note on its
status.
